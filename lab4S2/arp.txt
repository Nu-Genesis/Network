# Snort Rules for ARP Spoofing Detection and Prevention

## Understanding ARP Spoofing Attack Pattern

ARP spoofing (poisoning) attacks typically involve:
- Sending fake ARP responses to associate the attacker's MAC address with another device's IP
- Common targets: Default gateway IP or victim machine IP
- Results in man-in-the-middle positioning for traffic interception

## Custom Snort Rules for ARP Attack Detection

### Rule 1: Detect ARP Response Flooding
```
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ARP Response Flood Detected"; flags:A; flow:established; detection_filter:track by_src, count 10, seconds 5; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```

### Rule 2: Detect Gratuitous ARP Responses
```
alert ip $HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Gratuitous ARP Response - Possible ARP Spoofing"; content:"|00 01 08 00 06 04 00 02|"; offset:14; depth:8; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
```

### Rule 3: Detect ARP Requests with Non-Standard Patterns
```
alert ip $HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Suspicious ARP Request Pattern"; content:"|00 01 08 00 06 04 00 01|"; offset:14; depth:8; detection_filter:track by_src, count 5, seconds 3; sid:1000004; rev:1;)
```

### Rule 4: Detect ARP Replies from Non-Gateway Sources
```
alert ip !$HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ARP Reply from External Source - Possible Spoofing"; content:"|00 01 08 00 06 04 00 02|"; offset:14; depth:8; sid:1000005; rev:1;)
```

### Rule 5: Detect Duplicate IP Announcements
```
alert ip $HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Duplicate IP in ARP - Possible Spoofing Attack"; content:"|00 01 08 00 06 04 00 02|"; offset:14; depth:8; threshold:type both, track by_dst, count 2, seconds 10; sid:1000006; rev:1;)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Configure Snort Interface for Detection Mode
1. Access pfSense web interface
2. Navigate to Services > Snort
3. Edit LAN interface settings
4. Ensure "Block Offenders" is **DISABLED** for detection mode
5. Save settings

### Step 2: Add Custom Rules
1. Go to Services > Snort > LAN Interface
2. Click on "LAN Rules" tab
3. Select "custom.rules" category
4. Add the rules above one by one
5. Save after each rule addition

### Step 3: Configure for Prevention Mode (IPS)
1. Stop Snort service on LAN interface
2. Edit LAN interface settings
3. Enable "Block Offenders"
4. Set IPS Mode to "Legacy Mode"
5. Save settings and restart Snort

### Step 4: Test Rule Effectiveness
1. Start Snort on LAN interface
2. Perform ARP spoofing attack using Ettercap from attacker machine
3. Check Snort alerts: Services > Snort > Alerts
4. Verify blocked hosts: Services > Snort > Blocked (when in IPS mode)

## Rule Syntax Explanation

### Basic Rule Structure:
```
action protocol source_ip source_port -> dest_ip dest_port (rule options)
```

### Key Components Used:
- **alert**: Generate alert when rule matches
- **ip**: Match IP protocol (covers ARP at layer 2)
- **content**: Match specific hex patterns in packet payload
- **offset**: Start matching at specific byte position
- **depth**: Maximum bytes to search from offset
- **detection_filter**: Rate limiting to reduce false positives
- **threshold**: Trigger only after certain conditions met
- **sid**: Unique signature ID (1000000-1999999 for custom rules)

### ARP Packet Structure Reference:
- ARP Request: `00 01 08 00 06 04 00 01`
- ARP Reply: `00 01 08 00 06 04 00 02`
- These patterns appear at offset 14 in Ethernet frames

## Advanced Configuration Options

### For More Aggressive Detection:
```
alert ip $HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"High Volume ARP Traffic - Possible Attack"; detection_filter:track by_src, count 20, seconds 10; sid:1000007; rev:1;)
```

### For Specific Gateway Protection:
```
alert ip $HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ARP Spoofing - Gateway IP Targeted"; content:"|C0 A8 00 01|"; sid:1000008; rev:1;)
```
*Note: Replace `C0 A8 00 01` with hex representation of your gateway IP*

## Monitoring and Verification

### Check Rule Status:
- Services > Snort > LAN Rules > View rules to verify they're enabled
- Services > Snort > Logs > View logs for detailed rule processing

### Alert Analysis:
- Monitor Services > Snort > Alerts during attack simulation
- Look for rule SIDs 1000002-1000006 triggering
- Note source/destination IPs and timestamps

### Testing Effectiveness:
1. Baseline: Record normal ARP traffic patterns
2. Attack: Execute Ettercap ARP spoofing
3. Detection: Verify alerts generated
4. Prevention: Confirm attack blocked in IPS mode

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Rules Not Triggering:
- Verify Snort is running and processing traffic
- Check rule syntax for typos
- Ensure HOME_NET variable includes your network range
- Consider adjusting detection thresholds

### False Positives:
- Adjust detection_filter counts and timeouts
- Refine content matching patterns
- Add more specific IP range restrictions

### Performance Impact:
- Monitor CPU usage during high traffic
- Consider reducing rule complexity if needed
- Use threshold settings to limit alert frequency
